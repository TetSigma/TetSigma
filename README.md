Javascript (MERN Fullstack, and React Native) and Python developer 

Sometimes i like to test and try some new things, like coding GO socket apps, or even gameboy games with C

I use Windows, but last year i had a lot of experience with CTF challenges on Kali, and i use WSL when i need to configure servers for my projects
